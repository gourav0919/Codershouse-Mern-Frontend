// A error can come with saying that cors not accessible something this is a standard error so add cors in the backend or use proxy in the frontend whatever  of your choice

// one error is coming because of my nodemon server is creshed so it take my time
// one more error of can't set headers is coming because i did not return from the function i simply write the res.send or res.json which is wrong so use the return res.json or return res.send

// .env file written also did not work out so i have to restart my react APP

// now when our access token expires a new access token is generated with help  of refresh token

// now on the page refresh we are generating new tokens both access and refresh which increased the security and this is known as refresh token rotation so the work will be done in the app.js because it is responsibe for the rendering of all of the components
